# maze_thingies
some stuff in python in relation to maze generation and solving and other shit like that

1. maze_oop_gif.py : builds a maze, produces a list of cells, show it in the terminal in ascii and shows a picture (using PIL)
2. maze_oop.py : idem but shows the maze being constructed (with end list so it shows the walls not being there even at first pass) and saves the final as a jpg≈ì
3. maze_oop_gif_w_backtrack.py : idem but with an animated gif showing the backtracking (in white and red)
